Experience with Idris 1 suggests that feature requests and proposals tend to get buried among the bug reports in the issue tracker, even if we tag them effectively. Partly this is because there's not many people working on Idris full time (it's approximately one person at the moment).

We might be able to implement small suggestions fairly easily, but for larger features, please add the details on the wiki, at https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/wiki/Contributions-wanted, which I hope will be more discoverable. It's also a good idea to suggest it on the mailing list and/or the IRC channel. And if you're looking for inspiration for places to contribute, this is a good place to look too!

Please be as precise as you can about how your suggestion might work. For example, try to explain how it might impact other language features, give some ideas about how it might be implemented, and describe some things that will become possible if it is implemented. Remember that things can be more complicated than they might seem!
